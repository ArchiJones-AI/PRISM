# PRISM v3.2 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2024-12 (approximate)
**Theme:** Hybrid Prompt Support

---

## Executive Summary

PRISM v3.2 introduced prompt classification to distinguish between reference-only, operational-only, and hybrid prompts. This was an intermediate attempt to handle operational content that was ultimately superseded by v3.3's universal decomposition approach.

**Note:** v3.2's approach of preserving operational content in Instructions proved unscalable for large prompts. See v3.3 release notes for the resolution.

### Key Benefits

- **Prompt Classification** — Ability to identify prompt types before decomposition
- **Hybrid Templates** — Specialized handling for prompts that both transform and retrieve

### GTM Talking Points

- Introduced Phase 0 classification concept
- First attempt at handling operational prompts
- Foundation for v3.3's three-layer architecture

---

## Technical Changelog

### Added

- **Phase 0 Classification** (preliminary version) — Determine if prompt is REFERENCE, OPERATIONAL, or HYBRID
- **Three Instruction Templates**:
  - Reference template (for Q&A systems)
  - Operational template (for task-performing systems)
  - Hybrid template (for systems that transform using methodology)
- **Prompt Type Detection** — Guidance for identifying operational content

### The v3.2 Rule

"Preserve operational directives in Instructions. Only decompose reference material."

## Why v3.2 Was Superseded

The user question that exposed the flaw:

> "What if the instructions in the original prompt are so long? Say the monolithic prompt is 50,000-60,000 characters. Surely that prompt should be decomposed as well..."

v3.2 would fail for large operational prompts because it tried to stuff all operational logic into Instructions, exceeding practical limits.

**Resolution:** v3.3's insight that Instructions are CONDUCTORS, not CONTAINERS. Everything gets decomposed; the question is what KIND of file it becomes.

## Migration to v3.3

If you have a v3.2 system:

1. Identify operational content currently in Instructions
2. Create operational/ directory
3. Move operational content to operational files
4. Update Instructions to route to operational files
5. Add operational retrieval tests to test matrix

See [v3.3 release notes](v3.3.md) for detailed migration guide.
