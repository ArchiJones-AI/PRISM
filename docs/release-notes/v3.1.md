# PRISM v3.1 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2024-11 (approximate)
**Theme:** Retrieval Reliability

---

## Executive Summary

PRISM v3.1 established the foundational patterns for retrieval reliability in Claude Projects. This release introduced chunk resilience, concrete query examples, and hybrid retrieval optimization—patterns that remain core to all subsequent versions.

### Key Benefits

- **Chunk Resilience** — Content survives Claude Projects' arbitrary 400-800 token chunking
- **Concrete Examples** — 10-15 specific query examples replace abstract routing patterns
- **Hybrid Optimization** — Balance between BM25 keywords and embedding similarity

### GTM Talking Points

- Chunk-resilient paragraphs survive arbitrary splitting
- Concrete query examples improve routing accuracy
- Hybrid retrieval optimization balances keyword and semantic matching
- Anti-pattern documentation prevents common mistakes

---

## Technical Changelog

### Added

- **Chunk Resilience Guidelines**:
  - Paragraph autonomy (each paragraph works standalone)
  - Inverted pyramid structure (answer first, details after)
  - No cross-references between files
  - Open with context (no orphan "this" pronouns)

- **Concrete Query Examples** — Instructions now require 10-15 specific examples:
  ```markdown
  | User Query | Search For | Expected Domain |
  |------------|------------|-----------------|
  | "how do I reset my password?" | "password reset process" | account-management.md |
  ```

- **BM25 Keyword Distribution** — Guidance to distribute exact terms every 500-800 characters

- **Semantic Hedging** — Include synonym variations for embedding similarity

- **Anti-Pattern Documentation** — Common mistakes to avoid:
  - Context-free paragraphs
  - Front-loaded keywords
  - Keyword deserts
  - Giant sections
  - Cross-file references

---

## Assumptions and Limitations

v3.1 assumed:
- **Input is reference material** — Documentation, manuals, guides
- **Output is a Q&A system** — Users ask questions, system retrieves answers

This assumption was challenged when operational prompts (systems that DO things rather than just answer questions) needed decomposition. See v3.2 and v3.3 for evolution.

## Patterns Established

These v3.1 patterns remain valid in all subsequent versions:

1. **Chunk Resilience** — Every paragraph survives arbitrary splitting
2. **Keyword Distribution** — BM25 terms every 500-800 chars
3. **Semantic Hedging** — Synonym variations for embeddings
4. **Concrete Examples** — Specific query examples over abstract patterns
5. **Anti-Pattern Avoidance** — Documented mistakes to avoid
