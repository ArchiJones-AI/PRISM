# PRISM v3.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 2024-10 (approximate)
**Theme:** Foundation for Retrieval Optimization

---

## Executive Summary

PRISM v3.0 established the initial methodology for decomposing prompts into Claude Projects-optimized knowledge architectures. This foundational release introduced the core concepts of domain files, quality gates, and test matrices that underpin all subsequent versions.

### Key Benefits

- **Structured Decomposition** — Monolithic prompts become organized knowledge files
- **Retrieval Optimization** — Content structured for Claude Projects' Contextual Retrieval
- **Quality Verification** — Gates and test matrices ensure system reliability

### GTM Talking Points

- First chunk-aware decomposition methodology
- Designed specifically for Claude Projects integration
- Quality gates framework for verification
- Test matrix concept for retrieval accuracy

---

## Technical Changelog

### Added

- **Initial Methodology** — Framework for decomposing prompts into knowledge systems

- **Domain File Structure**:
  - Target size: 2,000-5,000 characters per file
  - Content organized by topic/domain
  - Optimized for retrieval chunking

- **Instructions Template** — Basic query routing structure

- **Quality Gates Framework** — Verification checkpoints before deployment

- **Test Matrix Concept** — Queries to verify retrieval accuracy

## Core Architecture

v3.0 introduced the basic architecture:

```
{system-name}/
├── INSTRUCTIONS.md    # Query routing
├── domain-1.md        # Knowledge domain
├── domain-2.md        # Knowledge domain
└── ...
```

## Foundation for Evolution

v3.0 established concepts that evolved in later versions:

| v3.0 Concept | Later Evolution |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Domain files | Split into reference/ and operational/ (v3.3) |
| Instructions | Conductor pattern (v3.3) |
| Quality gates | 8 gates with operational checks (v3.3, v3.4) |
| Test matrix | 7 query types (v3.3) |
| 2,000-5,000 char target | 2,000-6,000 chars (v3.4) |
